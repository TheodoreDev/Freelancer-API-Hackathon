#Freelancer API Hackathon

Create a website with a digital canvas to allow users to enter their shoe sizes and sketch different types of shoes they want. By using neural network machine learning, the sketches can be translated to visual products in real time (like below image). That shoe customization project with both of the sketch and virtual shoes images will be posted on the freelancer's website to find the manufacturers or crafters who can hand-made or 3D print them. Mind-blowing !!!

This definitely disrupt the customized shoe industry in general and increase the number of jobs in “Product Sourcing & Manufacturing” category which has only a few jobs compared to other categories in Freelancers website at the moment. By using machine learning, we allow clients to create their dream shoes with no limitation and translate that into reasonable visual image for freelancer manufacturer to easily understand the design.

The project is broken down into 3 main components:
A WordPress website with digital canvas to draw(sketch) using a JavaScript library
Deep neural network to convert the drawing from the canvas to visual image for shoes
Freelancer API component to take two images (raw sketch and visual shoe image) along with client details (name, shoe size) to create a project on Freelancer website in “Product Sourcing & Manufacturing” category so any freelancer can bid to produce the customized shoes for clients.
